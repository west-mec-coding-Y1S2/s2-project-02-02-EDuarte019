        <h1>What Your Support Does</h1>
        <p>Every 10 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her first reaction is fear and confusion. Support is just
            a phone call or mouse click away. Our free services offer a friendly ear and expert guidance to anyone dealing
            with this life-threatening illness.</p>
        <p>By running or walking with us, you can ensure that we are there when people need us. Here is how your contribution
            can help:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>$15</strong> pays for a headscarf set, boosting the confidence of women who have lost their hair from her
                breast cancer treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>$50</strong> trains a member of our support network for a year to help improve the care of women with breast
                cancer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>$125</strong> covers the cost of counselling sessions to help women cope with the distress of their cancer
                treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>$250</strong> funds a hospital information station for a year so that people affected by breast cancer have
                easy access to the latest resources and help.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <!--I placed another section element to seperate the information from the one on top. I also nested an image with the img tag. Then, I placed an h1 tag to show importance to the title. Then, placed a paragraph tag to place the information inside. A strong tag to make it bold. The h2 and p tags are placed to show the information of the different points. Aslo, placed the email in an anchor tag so the reader can easily access it like they can access the accommodation question with the anchor tag.-->

            <h1>Diane's Run - September 9, 2017</h1>
            <p> Join over 2000 athletes in Cheyenne, Wyoming, for
                <strong>Diane's Run</strong> to raise money for breast cancer awareness and research. The 5K and 10K races are challenging,
                yet attainable. You can aim for a personal best while taking part to raise money for this important charity.
                If you can't run, consider walking; joining young and old in the fight by participating in the 1-Mile Walk
                for Hope.
            </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Since its inception in 2004, Diane's Run has grown from a purely local event involving 100 runners to a signature
                Wyoming event with more than 2000 participants annually. The event is enormously effective in spreading the
                message that breast cancer need not be fatal if caught early enough with mammography and breast self-exam.
                As well as a top-flight athletic event, Diane's Run is an emotionally moving event attracting many first
                timers and recreational runners. This event provides all of us with the opportunity to spread a hopeful message
                about breast cancer to our families and our communities.</p>
            <h2>Remembering Diane</h2>
            <p>Diane's Run is named in remembrance of Diane Wheaton, mother of 2 and wife of Peter, who passed away in May,
                2003. Diane was an outspoken advocate of physical fitness and healthy living. She was an inspiration to all
                who knew her and continues to be an inspiration to the thousands of runners who have participated in this
                event. We hope you can join us this year and become part of the Diane's Run family.</p>
